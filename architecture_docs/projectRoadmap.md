# ChoirLoop - Project Roadmap

## Project Vision
A browser-based practice tool for choirs that allows choir members to practice specific sections from MIDI files with individual voice control.

## High-Level Goals

### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- [ ] MIDI file upload and parsing
- [ ] Basic playback of individual voices
- [ ] Simple volume control per track
- [ ] Manual definition of start/end measures
- [ ] Loop function (endless)
- [ ] File-based storage system (JSON)

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Admin interface for defining practice sections
- [ ] Playlist view for all practice sections
- [ ] Tempo control (50% - 150%)
- [ ] Count-in before loops
- [ ] Configurable repetitions (default 3x)
- [ ] Three practice modes:
  - Focus on own voice
  - With choir
  - Without own voice

### Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience
- [ ] PDF sheet music display
- [ ] Synchronized scrolling with playback
- [ ] MusicXML support
- [ ] MP3 fallback for iOS devices
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

### Phase 4: Community Features
- [ ] Multi-user management
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Sharing practice sections
- [ ] Recording function
- [ ] Transposition support
- [ ] Metronome integration

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Choir leaders can upload MIDI files and define practice sections
- [ ] Choir members can select their voice and practice specific sections
- [ ] Individual volume control for each voice works reliably
- [ ] Loop function works with configurable repetitions and count-in
- [ ] Tempo control functions smoothly (50%-150%)
- [ ] Application works offline as PWA
- [ ] Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop and mobile)

## Completed Tasks
<!-- Tasks will be marked here as they are completed -->

## Future Considerations
